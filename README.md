# Floral: A High-Performance, Safe, and Simple Language

**Floral** is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed to combine the **simplicity of Python** with the **performance of low-level languages**. It offers **zero garbage collection**, relying on advanced **compile-time memory management** ([RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization)) to ensure memory safety and eliminate leaks without sacrificing developer productivity. Floral's syntax is intuitive and expressive, making it easy to learn and use while still providing powerful tools for optimization and resource management.

**Floral** enforces best practices to prevent **bad patterns** and encourage **efficient code**. It enables developers to write high-level abstractions, while the underlying compiler ensures **optimized execution**. **Polymorphism, object and data-oriented programming** are first-class citizens, giving developers flexibility and power to design robust, high-performance systems.

Floral brings the best of both worlds: simplicity and safety, with the performance and control typically found in low-level languages like C and Rust. It is the ideal choice for developers who want to write clean, safe, and efficient code without the overhead of garbage collection.
